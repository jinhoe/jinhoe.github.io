I felt relieved after completed this super compact (link: /google-it-automation-professional-certificate text: Python programming course). It is quite intense for a semi-beginner like me. I said semi because I can understand certain Python functions and syntaxs due to my chatbot background.

It was designed to be a 8-month course, 4 hours per week. But I rush through it in 2 months because I have more than 4 hours to spare!

Anyway I intent to specialize in Python language. So moving forward I will work on personal project to solve my own problems with Python. Hope to publish my projects in GitHub too.
