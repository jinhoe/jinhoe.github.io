Title: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

Text:

Today I've passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam! Yay!

It has been a long time since I studied hard for an exam. It is because I have to pay for the exam fee and you can only retake it by paying it again and reschedule another day.

Although my current project is not using AWS, I figured it is the most popular cloud services in the IT world. So soon or later I'll need to "play" with it. Hence I registered for the exam.

I think AWS needs to name their services better in a way that is self-explanatory. I had a hard time remembering the function of their services.

Nevertheless I'll share my learning journey here in case someone might benefit from it.

First, the exam fee is USD 100 which is quite costly. However I believe there are subsidies available. You can check if your company can sponsors you. If not, during the time of my learning I came across two programs.

Cloud Practitioner Challenge offers a 50% discount and AWS She Builds offers a free exam voucher but only for women. So I took the Cloud Practitioner Challenge and only paid USD 50 for the exam. By the time you read this piece, the offer has expired. But go to the website to search for upcoming programs anyway.

I started my learning with courses provided by AWS, LinkedIn Learning, YouTube video then follow by Questionaire. I would recommend you to do some questionnaire in-between those video courses. Personally I absorb better this way.

### Tips before the exam

I allocated 3 hours before the exam to recap what I've learnt.

- Rewatch the **Summary videos** of AWS Skill Builder: AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
- Rewatch the **Study Break videos** of LinkedIn Learning: Prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Exam
- Glance though all the **Questionnaire** that I've done wrong previously.

Rest for 30 mins then login to AWS Certification Account and test my browser compatibility with their system. Heads-up, it took me a while to get their secured browser installed and setup.

That's all folks and good luck!
