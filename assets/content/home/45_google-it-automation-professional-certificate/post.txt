Title: Google IT Automation Professional Certificate

----

Text:

Last week I was pretty excited when I read an article about (link: https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/google-launches-professional-certificates-in-singapore-forms-employer-consortium text: Google launches professional certificates in Singapore). I'm curious what kind of courses they are offering this time. Data Analytics, IT Support, IT Automation and UX Design.

To be honest, I feel like learning Data Analytics, IT Automation and UX Design. Haha! But IT Automation is the one that I'm most interested in. Automation has always been a part of me. Always trying to automate repetitive task to improve my workflow.

I'm glad the course fee is just S$53 per month so there is no reason for me not to jump in! In case you are interested, click (link: https://www.coursera.org/google-career-certificates text: here) to check out the Google courses.
