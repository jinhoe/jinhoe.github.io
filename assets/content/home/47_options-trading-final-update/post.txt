Title: Options trading final update

----

Text:

It was a bearish market in January and I expect the bearish trend continue in February. I did not sell any put options, but sold covered calls and credit spread. The returns for January is about 0.8% positive mainly because I am still testing the results of credit spread hence those positions are relatively small.

This month I may try out debit spread as well. Also DCA into some of my shortlisted stocks listed below. I decided to stop updating my options trading chart because it wasn't accurate.

My main stocks and options trading are in the same account which makes the accounting challenging. I had cash in my account which was intended for options trading but I used it to buy some shares. So the return is kind of messed up.

Anyhow I plan to continue recording my learning progress just not on a monthly basis. Oh btw, 新年快乐!
