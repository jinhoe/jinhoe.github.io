I’ve been a big fan of Manu ever since I bought his website template. I like his taste of simplicity and design. I like how he decluttered digitally.

Today I just read his (link: https://manuelmoreale.com/good-enough/ text: blog) that motivates me to write this post now. What he wrote is really spot on, as if he knew me and is telling me not to make the mistake.

Yeah, so he wrote that when comes to blogging, we should not fine-tuning our writing, choosing the perfect words, correcting the grammar, etc.

A personal blog should seems more like a conversation. When you talk to someone, you don’t say the same thing four different times. You just talk, communicate and clarify it.

Hell yeah! Having to “perfect” my post is definitely stopping me from posting all together. So from now on, my post will be like this. Just like how I would text a friend. Short and sweet or whatever.
