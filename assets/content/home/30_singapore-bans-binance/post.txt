Title: Singapore bans Binance

----

Text:

Recently MAS ordered Binance.com to stop providing payment services to Singapore residents. I'm a little worried as I have some cryptocurrency with Binance.

One option is to transfer the funds to another crypto exchange like Gemini or you could transfer it to a crypto wallet like MetaMask.

But I'll go with hardwallet as it the recommended safest way to store your cryptocurrency offline. This way I don't have to worry about anything else. I'll just keep my hardwallet in my drawer and hopefully 10 years later I will become very rich. Haha!

In case you are wondering, I've bought Ledger Nano S. Probably I will continue to use Binance.com for future transaction since their rate is the lowest, but transfer the crypto back to my hardwallet once done. Never leave your crypto in a crypto exchange platform.

>Important Note: Buy direct from https://www.ledger.com, don't buy from anywhere else.

If you also bought a Ledger Nano S, you can watch Kelvin Gor Gor's video on how to use it.
