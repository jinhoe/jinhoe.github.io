Title: Monster Hunter Now

----

Text:

Lately I'm into Monster Hunter Now. It can be a good family bonding acitivity (like Pokemon Go) during the weekend if one can manage the addiction properly. Now my son talks to me about the monsters and weapons all the time. I also spread the virus to friends and colleagues, lol. Good things must share right? Haha.

I'm also thinking maybe I should create YouTube content about it while the game still at infant stage. Well, maybe not cause I'm too lazy to even maintain this website.

Ok, the purpose of this post is when you create your Monster Hunter Now account, don't forget to enter my **referral code** below to get rewards! Hehe.
