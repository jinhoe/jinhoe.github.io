Title: I sold my FBRX shares

Last september, FBRX gave me a big birthday present by (link: /worse-trading-nightmare text: falling 82% in a day). From $30 to $1.5 as of today. This marked my second biggest lost in trading options at $3000. Ouch! Almost enough cash to buy me 2 Apple Studio Display! Sad, but valuable lesson.

I've decided it is time for me to let go and reinvest in other growth stock that has higher probability of upside in this correction market.

Lesson learnt: Exit early if you no longer believe in the company. Holding on will only bleed more.
