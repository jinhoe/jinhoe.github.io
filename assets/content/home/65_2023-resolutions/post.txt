Title: 2023 Resolutions

----

Text:

This year my focus will be health and education. Last year I did  not start a running routine so this year I will try again! This year is different because I am force to wake up at 6am, 1.5 hours earlier because my son is now in primary one. After sending him to school, I have an extra hour for running. Today mark my 2nd day of running. I hope I can make it a habit.

Next, I want to brush up my Machine Learning skills and build up some projects. Hmmm... that's all. Nothing fanciful.
