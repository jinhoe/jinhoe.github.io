Title: Quality time

Text:

I had a long lunch with brothers in a hawker centre just now. At my age venue is not important, the company is.

Seating at a quiet corner with a cup of kopi. With the right kakis, the surrounding was simply blurred out when we were chatting our hearts out.

We can have the same amount of quality time anywhere else.
