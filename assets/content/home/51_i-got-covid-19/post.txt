I'm tested positive for Covid-19. Got it from my son who tested positive a few days ago. I was mentally prepared since I have a lot of physical contact with him. My wife is negative but she's worried being surrounded by Covid-19!

My symptoms were mild, like dry throat and body aching. The type of feeling just before fever. That's when I knew the virus had invaded my body.

For Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms can get results certified for free at test centres, instead of GPs. The purpose of doing so is to get the result reflected in MOH's medical record.

In Singapore, an infection episode can be considered a booster dose if a person prefers not to get the extra jab. And we can collect three free ART kits. Thank you!

Members of the public can book their supervised self-administered ART (link: https://go.gov.sg/community-ART-test text: at this website.)
