Title: Job alert script

----

Text:

#### Problem
Going through tons of job posting in (link:https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg text:MyCareersFuture portal) has been a daily morning chore for me. Despite the site having a job alert feature, it does not serve my needs. So I decided to take this opportunity to practice my Git and Python skills.

What I want is to receive an email of curated job posting every morning.

#### Solution
I used Selenium and Beautiful Soup in the Python script to extract job posting that matches my four pre-defined variables and then send it to my email.

This script will run daily at 8:15am on my MacBook using Cronjob. As my Macbook sleeps when inactive, I have to use MacOs System Preference to schedule a Wake and Sleep time like this:

- 8:14am - MacBook wakes up
- 8:15am - Run Python script
- 8:16am - MacBook goes back to sleep

The action happens when I'm preparing my son for school. I love automation! The following four pre-defined variables condition must match in order to be listed in the email:

1. **coy_keywords** - Exclude keyword in company name. For some reasons, I do not want job post by recruitment firm so the company name should not have "recruitment" related word in it. Or some other company I do not wish to work for.

2. **job_keywords** - Include keyword in job title. Obviously the job title must have the keywords I'm looking for. Such as "machine learning", "devops", etc.

3. **exp_keywords** - Exclude keyword in job title. I'm looking for a junior role, so the job title should not have words like "senior", "lead", etc.

4. **expected_salary** - If the minimum salary is below my expected amount, the job post will be ignore.

#### Next Challenge
When this project is working well, I proudly offered to help my wife shorten her job searching time. However she threw me another request. "What about (link:https://www.jobstreet.com.sg text: JobStreet)?", she asked.

Challenge Accepted!

On top of that, I asked a friend of mine who is working in HR which other popular job seeking platform. He told me (link:https://sg.linkedin.com/jobs text:LinkedIn Jobs) is another common platform used by recruitment firm. So my next challenge would be adding JobStreet and LinkedIn Jobs into the script!
