Title: Don’t bro me

----

Text:

Don’t get me wrong, I still address people as bro from time to time. But not when I’m speaking to a stranger for the first time.

Once I felt extremely uncomfortable when received a call from an agent for co-broking. He kept calling me bro as if we were BFF.

Another occasion was from a cold call. This salesperson is trying too hard to be friendly.

>Never ever ever address someone as bro when doing cold calling. Never!

***

Don’t bro me, I’m not your brother.
