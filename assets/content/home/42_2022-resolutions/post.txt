If I have to use one word to describe my 2021, that would be Investing. I wish I have pay more attention in investing much earlier. Anyway, I'm glad to learnt a lot about investing last year and options trading along the way.

This year I will focus on my health. I started (link: /16-8-diet text: 16:8 diet) a month ago. Hopefully I can continue it through 2022 and beyond. I will need to start a regular running routine instead of ad-hoc approach. I've been trying out (link: https://sg.iherb.com/pr/nordic-naturals-ultimate-omega-xtra-lemon-740-mg-60-soft-gels/39278 text: Omega-3 supplememt) lately due to recommendation by my friends.

Cryptocurrency is something we need to adapt eventually. I will also pay a lot more attention to it this year.

Lastly I hope 2022 will be a year where COVID-19 evolve into a flu-like virus and we resume our lifes as we normally would.
