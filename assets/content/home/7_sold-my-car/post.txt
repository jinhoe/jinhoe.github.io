Title: Sold my car

----

Text:

Early this year, I realized I’ve not been using my car that much. So the thought of selling the car to save $40+ per day is quite tempting. I can easily Grab if I want to and still possibly have some balance left. That’s how I embark on this “selling car” journey. I’ve created a video on the steps I took to (link: https://youtu.be/DrkOKw_nWYQ text: sell my car without a car dealer).

If you intent to sell your car directly to buyer without car dealers or you are still deciding whether to engage a car dealer, then this video is for you.
