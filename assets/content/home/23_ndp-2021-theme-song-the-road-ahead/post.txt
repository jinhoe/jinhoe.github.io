Title: NDP 2021 Theme Song – The Road Ahead

----

Text:

Ever since Kit Chan’s 家, there isn’t another NDP theme song that catches my attention. Not even the English version - Home.

But this year is different. The song is truly heartwarming. Not only it catches my attention but also touches my heart. In a difficult period like this, this is the perfect song to hold us together and unified as one.

The Road Ahead was written and composed by singer-songwriter Linying and music producer Evan Low. Performed By Linying, Sezairi Sezali, Shye-Anne Brown and Shabir Tabare Alam.

Thank you everyone. The lyrics was well-written and matches with your angelic voices.
