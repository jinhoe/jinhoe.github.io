I think Iâ€™m a nature guy. Whenever my mind is stuck I would come to places like this to find my inner peace. Usually to greenery places like park.

I like to set aside 1-2 hours of time doing nothing there. Just let my mind rest. Taking a break. Feeling very uncle now. The older I gets the more I need such moment. Very sad.

Anyway today I decided to write this post while admiring the view in front of me. Nothing spectacular, just calm water with very minimum movement. Watching it moves somehow has a calming effect on my mind as well.

What did you do to unwind yourself? Grab a beer or have a big feast?
