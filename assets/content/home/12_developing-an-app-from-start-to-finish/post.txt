Title: Developing an app from start to finish

----

Text:

This morning I watched a video demo about developing an app from start to finish. I'm always curious about the entire process of developing an app since I wasn't sure where or how to start.

This one hour video: (link: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/203/ text: I Have This Idea For An App...) from WWDC 2018 gives me a better overview which helps me to breakdown what are the skillset or software I need to learn.
