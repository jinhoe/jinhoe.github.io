Today I revamped my blog site. For the third time.

Coincidently it's the 4th month since I started my first blog. Wow, every blog site design last me slightly more than a month.

This time round was a major revamped and an experiment. I’m not using Wordpress, but a file-based CMS called (link: https://getkirby.com text: Kirby). After using Wordpress for so long, Kirby blew my mind. The installation was insanely simple. Just drag files into public_html folder and DONE!
