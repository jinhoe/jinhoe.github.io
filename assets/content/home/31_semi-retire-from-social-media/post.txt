Title: Semi-retire from social media

----

Text:

I wrote about my attempt of (link: /reduce-social-media-consumption text: reducing social media consumption). So far removing apps from Home Screen seems to be effective. My social media screen time has reduced to 30 mins or less a day.

Last week I've deleted Facebook and Instagram app from the phone. I hope there is no urge for me to install them back.

Why I said semi-retire is because occasionally I need to post some marketing content for my business account. And I still glance few minutes at my Facebook feed in the morning via desktop.

Not celebrating yet. I find myself using Twitter, Discord and Reddit to check on market update frequently now. Shit...
