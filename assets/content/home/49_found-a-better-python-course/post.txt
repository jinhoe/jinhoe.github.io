Title: Found a better Python course

----

Text:

I chanced upon a 6 hours (link: https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc text: Python course for beginners) on YouTube. It was so good that I had to write about it.

You see, I'm still learning the (link: /google-it-automation-professional-certificate text: Python course from Google) that Iâ€™ve enrolled last month. Their course curriculum is very well organised but there are moments where I was completely lost. Sometimes the question in the quiz are not being taught at all. So in my opinion it is not a hand holding course for beginner thus far.

Luckily I found this course by Mosh which was designed for beginners. People that know nothing about programming will benefit from it. After every question he will explain his answer in code line by line. That makes it easy to follow along.

If you are interested in learning Python, I highly recommend you to watch his video. Sure, he is trying to sell some courses but I don't care. The free YouTube version is already mind-blowing, I'm sure the paid course is worth every penny.
