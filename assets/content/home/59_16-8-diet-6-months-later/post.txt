Title: 16:8 Diet 6 months later

----

Text:

Woo, after 6 months of 16:8 diet, I am very satisfied with the result. I’ve lost 4.6kg and 4cm waist circumference. 

Throughout the journey I lived normally as in I did not go for healthy food nor did I exercise more than usual. I simply try to follow the eating window strictly as much as possible. I would only break fast for a friend or family gathering.

By the way waistline is the hardest area to reduce. I only see result after one month so don’t give up too soon if you aim to get back your old waist.

If you refer to the graph below, my weight has reduced consistently. However 5th month onwards there is no progress at all. Probably I’ve hit the limit of the 16:8 Diet, I can’t be losing weight until 0 right?

To break the limit, my next experiment would be having overnight oats for lunch. Probably 5 days a week. Let’s see if I can reach my target of 55kg. Jia you!
