Today I would like to introduce you a person whom I looked up to 15 years ago. His name is 余世维.

I chanced upon his video in Shanghai Pudong Airport while waiting for my flight back home. It was a business trip. As I walked passed a bookstore, I was drawn to a video played in front of the counter. It was showing one of 余世维's seminar video.

For some reason, his speech seems to have this addictive effect. Once you listen, you can't stop. It was very educational and his way of teaching and presenting is incredible.

If I can only recommend one of his seminar, I would say is 有效沟通. Means effective communication. Regardless of your age or working industry, I am certain it will make your time worth well.

Here's the playlist of 有效沟通 seminar for your convenient.

I'm glad after 15 years he is still active in the educational world. I found a few short series of video about parenting. Exactly what I needed now. Below are the playlists.
