Title: Intensive learning

----

Text:

Recently I'm in intensive learning mode. The subject is Options Trading.

Just like back in the days when I first discovered chatbot building and how easy it is to built it without coding. I went into intensive learning mode. I would drop everything and enroll for online courses, watch a lot of YouTube videos, read Facebook Group content and Google for answers.

I'm doing the same now for Options Trading. Which explain why I didn't write much this month. I will share the progress I've made since April at the end of the month.

So far this month result has been promising but fingers crossed. ðŸ¤ž
