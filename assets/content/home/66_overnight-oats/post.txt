Title: Overnight Oats

----

Text:

Few months after my 168 diet, I reached a state where my weight stabilized. But it’s not my desired weight yet so I knew I had to do something.

All along I have been wanting to cutdown outside food intake so I started light cooking for my lunch in early 2022. However I was assigned to a project where WFH is not possible. So the cooking stopped.

Then one day, during a family gathering I asked my sister-in-law for some advice as she prepared her breakfast and lunch to work everyday.

She told me about oats and how easy it is to prepare. Best of all no cooking is needed! After watching a few YouTube videos this recipe is what I’ve been using:

I tweaked the recipe to my own liking. So here’s my overnight oats recipe I’ve been using so far:

- 8 x tbsp old fashion rolled oats
- 10 x tbsp milk
- 4 x tbsp greek yogurt
- 1 x tsp chia seed
- 1 x tsp black sesame powder
- 1 x tsp walnut
- 1 x tsp almond
- 1 x tsp sunflower
- 1 x tsp pumpkin seed
- 1 x raw honey
- Any fruits I can find, but usually apple.
tbsp = tablespoon, tsp = teaspoon

Stay healthy.
